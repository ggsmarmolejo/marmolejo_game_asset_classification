Hello! I am GlAIZA GYNN S. MARMOLEJO, a BSCS 3A-AI student of WVSU-CICT.

This README.md file contains the Streamlit file and accompanying CSV file named with 
'symbols.csv' that were uploaded from my previous activity. The submission serves as 
part of the new assignment for the 'Symbol Recognizer using Logistic Regression and 
Naive Bayes on Streamlit'. The contents have been updated and modified to meet the 
requirements of this assignment.
